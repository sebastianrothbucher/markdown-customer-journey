# markdown-customer-journey
Simple script anyone can use in markdown (e.g. github pages blog) to render plain text (Step 1, Step 2, Step 3) as visual customer journey.

TL;DR: render a visual customer journey from text by embedding the following two lines into your markdown

```html
<script src="https://sebastianrothbucher.github.io/markdown-customer-journey/journey.js" integrity="sha256-D3HE7MCcr+8t3sfyX6fjWfA7IWWGs7rP9OcY+UwNmQs=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://sebastianrothbucher.github.io/markdown-customer-journey/journey.css" integrity="sha256-HS161UTL65qQ6bfBULdFvROSbEE9w8uTvXvVJbTvvAk=" crossorigin="anonymous" />
```

I've written this up more extensively in my [blog post](https://sebastianrothbucher.github.io/pm/project/work/briefing/value/quality/delivery/2024/04/01/markdown-customer-journey-from-simple-text.html)

Many thanks to Jacob Okamoto who had this idea first - just for D3 and graphviz instead of some specific CSS+SVG. You can read about it in his blog here: [ howto => GraphViz in Markdown](https://oko.io/howto/graphviz-in-markdown/)
